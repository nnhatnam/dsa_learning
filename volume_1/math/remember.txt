"PREMATURE OPTIMIZATION IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL"

Conditionals are slower than plain arithmetic operations, but much, much faster than something as silly as calculating the square root.

Rules of thumb from my assembly days:

Integer or bitwise op: 1 cycle
Floating-point add/sub/mul: 4 cycles
Floating-point div: ~30 cycles
Floating-point exponentiation: ~200 cycles
Floating-point sqrt: ~60 cycles depending on implementation
Conditional branch: avg. 10 cycles, better if well-predicted, much worse if mispredicted
